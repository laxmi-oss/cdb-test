# Workshop Introduction and Overview

# Introduction

Unlike the Oracle Database, limited function databases lead developers to write a lot more code and makes IT infrastructure overly complex, brittle, and fragile. As businesses reach for digital transformation, they are finding that integrating all the critical functionality they need — IoT, machine learning, blockchain, and more — via traditional methods isn’t working. What they need is a database that provides seamless convergence and integration of data types and workloads, availability, security, performance plus support for the latest development methodologies like SaaS, events, and CI/CD. This integration is critical to leveraging these technologies to transform the business. In this talk we'll introduce the concept behind such “data-driven applications” to help you open up conversations with your database customer about how to get the most from their Oracle Database when developing applications.

Oracle Spatial and Graph offers the industry’s most comprehensive, advanced database for enterprise spatial applications and high performance, secure graph databases. With Oracle Database 19c, in the cloud and on premises, Spatial and Graph powers applications from GIS and location services to fraud detection, social networks, linked data and knowledge management. The spatial features of Spatial and Graph include both basic spatial data management and analysis and additional high-end functionality including: spatial aggregates, 3D, LiDAR, geospatial imagery, geocoding, routing, and linear referencing. Oracle Spatial and Graph is included at no extra cost with all Oracle Database cloud services and on-prem editions.
